This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(randomForestSRC)
library(MASS)
```

```{r}
Pollute <- readxl::read_excel("AirQualityUCI.xlsx")
```

```{r}
pollutants <- c(3:13)
Pollute[pollutants] <- lapply(Pollute[pollutants], function(x) na_if(x, -200))
```

```{r}
Pollute1 <- Pollute[3:13]
```

```{r}
rf_imp <- rfsrc(data = Pollute1, nodesize = 1, nsplit = 10, nimpute = 5)
```

```{r}
ImputedPollute <- rf_imp$xvar
```
